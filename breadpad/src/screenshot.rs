//! `--screenshot` CLI mode: render breadpad's compose popup, capture it via
//! `bread-screenshots`, then exit — driven by `bread-ecosystem`'s
//! `bread-capture` orchestrator, or run standalone for one-off captures.
//!
//! No clap here (unlike breadbar/breadbox/breadclip/breadsearch): breadpad
//! already has its own small hand-rolled flag parser (`mod args`) covering
//! `--type`/`--no-classify`/`--status`/`fire`/`calendar`/etc, and clap's
//! default "reject unknown flags" behavior would break every one of those
//! if bolted on as a second, separate parser. `--screenshot`/`--output`/
//! `--width`/`--height` are just three more fields on that same `Args`
//! struct instead.
//!
//! Only the "popup" view (the compose window from `run_popup`) is wired up
//! — the reminder window (`run_reminder_window`, reached via `fire <id>`)
//! needs a real stored `Note` to render, which isn't worth fabricating for
//! a screenshot pass.
